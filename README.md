Problem Statement: Create a Basic Template for Portfolio Website using React framework along with three.js library. Website should have unique way of displaying one’s portfolio along with having professional guidelines. It shouldn’t be having too much content, but still message should be clear. Themes should be added as well. 

How the project works: 

The website is developed using React Framework. One can access its main file through React Folder following àsrc àindex.js, this will further lead to display of the main website. 

The website consists of the following pages: 

Home: It gives description of the person with his/her image. 

It also consists of a top-bar which has the website name and toggle bar to navigate through the website.  

Portfolio: This section displays the work examples of the person. 

Skills: It showcases the various technical skills in a span model bar. 

Testimonials: This section shows the verdict/review of other ‘xyz’ professional to the person owning the portfolio, this section has a hovering animation on each review. 

Contacts: the section gives message box to write any queries with a send button and socials account display in the form of icons. 

To run this website, we recommend to use the software terminal of VS code or a windows command prompt in the project folder of portfolio like to start the website by typing the command ‘npm start’. 

The website will open in your default browser.
